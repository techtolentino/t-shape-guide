One area that I feel very passionate about is in personal and professional development in others. In my own career journey, I've been a beneficiary of some inspirational leaders who have not only shaped my career, but many have also shaped me as a person. I would love to explore the required skilset for managers at IBM. A few ways that I can begin to work on this goal include the following:

  - interview people that already hold this position to discover what their experiences are
  - volunteer at events or workshops where my areas of expertise are needed
  - attend team or dev-specific leadership conferences
  - take courses or training that cover topics such as interpersonal skills, feedback, processes, and people management
