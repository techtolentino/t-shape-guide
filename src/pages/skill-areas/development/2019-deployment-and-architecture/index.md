In my previous experience, only backend devs or the dev lead held the keys to deployment. For other developers on the team, this meant that architecture decisions, deployment processes, and automation was more of a mystery. I've always been interested in knowing how deployments work. The objective of this goal is to learn:

  - IBM Cloud deployment processes
  - a deeper understanding of Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment practices
  - learning Jenkins (similar to Travis CI)
  - deploy at least one personal application to IBM Cloud, with a fully automated process
