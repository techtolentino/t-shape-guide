Animation is difficult, and I'm currently only familiar with basic CSS animations. In today's dev landscape, animation is achieved through Javascript, various JS libraries, and through the Web Animations API as well. In the upcoming year, my goals that revolve around UI animation include:

  - learning new approaches through Javascript
  - learn the Web Animations API and needed fallbacks for unsupporting browsers
  - figuring out how to communicate animation specs
