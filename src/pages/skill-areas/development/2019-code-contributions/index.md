One of the ways that I can be most valuable on the Security team is through the contributions of code. In the next year, I envision accomplishing this through the following ways:

  - finishing and maintaining the Security Experience Guide
  - delivering implemented experiences to the XFE-ISC code base
  - contributing to Carbon Security Addons
  - making open-source contributions to Carbon elements repos
