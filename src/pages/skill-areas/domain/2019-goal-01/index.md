Aside from learning through working on a product team or seeing what other designers are doing through Design Jams, I'd love to extend my understanding of the larger Enterprise Security ecosystem. 

I believe this will not only help better understand who we're designing and building for, but it will also help me contribute new ideas as we progress as a team. My plan is to leverage a variety of resources to deepen my knowledge in our domain through the following:

  - leveraging outside resources such as Krebs On Security to keep up to date with the landscape
  - earning at least 2 IBM Badges in the Security Domain
