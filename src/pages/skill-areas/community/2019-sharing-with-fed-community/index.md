One of the most exciting aspects of being in the tech industry a front end developer is that the technology is constantly changing. Not only do code bases and libraries continuously evolve, but so do best practices, workflows, and processes. At some point this year, it is a goal of mine to share a learning experience with the IBM FED Community. Some ideas include:

  - Interpersonal and Soft Skills
  - Career Pathing in a Confusing Landscape
  - Creating an app to open-source and share
