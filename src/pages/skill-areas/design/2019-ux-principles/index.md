One thing I don't want is to be a Front End Developer only. I believe that developers should have empathy for the users and be connected to their experiences versus just building components, views, and applications. 

I'd like to reach a point where I can articulate every moment and experience that I'm working on and tie it into specific user pain points or enablements. I'd be interested in helping contribute to UX practices in some of the following areas:

  - acquiring user interview certificate
  - sitting in on testing sessions
  - providing feedback during design jams
  - absorbing thoughts, patterns, and expectations through design jams
  - accessibility
