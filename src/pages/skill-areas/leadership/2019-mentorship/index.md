It has always been in my personal culture to help others, specifically in areas where I'm considered an established professional. Mentorship, in my opinion, is the unofficial manager role, and I've had prior success in being both a mentee and a mentor. 

I would love to be in the position one day where I can officially help early-career professionals navigate their own goals and enable them grow into what they envision for themselves. In this upcoming year, I plan on doing the following:

  - mentor at least two early-career professionals, either within IBM or external to the company
  - connect with a younger generation of students (elementary, middle, high, and college levels)
