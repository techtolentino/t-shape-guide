Having a strong grasp on the latest accessibility specs and best practices is cross-discipline responsibility. While I have a decent level of understanding, I could definitely improve in the following areas:

  - UI elements (typeface, color-contrast, spacing)
  - understanding assistive devices and how to test using them
  - keying through an application
