In the context of product teams, I believe that every designer should have option of having the latest source code on their own computer. This would enable them to run a local server and have a closer look at what the developers have built. In addition, this can also allow designers to make code contributions if they want to. In order to enable designers to accomplish this, my goal is to:  

  - document a process that would allow designers to download and have the latest source code
  - prepare a simple training or asynchrnous workshop which would walk designers through how to spin up a local instance of the app they work with
  - become a reliable point of contact for designers with GitHub questions or issues
