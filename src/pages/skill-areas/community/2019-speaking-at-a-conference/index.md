In the past, I've applied to speak at the Lead Dev Conference which is a yearly event held in London, NY, and Austin. While my previous attempts have been declined, I do feel that I have enough experience to share with a larger community. I chose the Lead Dev Conference specifically because they tend to feature topics that interest me most with talks around people, teams, and growing leaders. I plan to continue these talking engagement proposals and my goals around this include:  

  - keeping a list of talk-worthy subjects and stories
  - sharing in smaller speaking opportunities, in Studio for example
  - volunteering at leadership-based events with the hopes of attending as well
